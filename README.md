Interactive Map submission!

Few things to note...

A. Make sure to change your FourSquareAPI if this code doesn't work.
B. Be sure to use "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo" to make a server proxy
C. If there's no instant hits off of any of the types of businesses, try scrolling around the map a bit...
some places that are clearly restaurants or markets or hotels don't show up as they maybe should? I believe it has something to do with the FourSquare Fetch
